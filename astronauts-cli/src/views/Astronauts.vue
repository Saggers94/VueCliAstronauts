              >Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. was born on January 20, 1930, at
              Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. His parents,
              Edwin Eugene Aldrin Sr. and Marion Aldrin (n√©e Moon), lived in
              neighboring Montclair. His father was an Army aviator during World
              War I and the assistant commandant of the Army&#039;s test pilot
              school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922, but left the Army
              in 1928 and became an executive at Standard Oil. Aldrin had two
              siblings, both sisters: Madeleine, who was four years older, and
              Fay Ann, who was a year and a half older. His nickname, which
              became his legal first name in 1988, arose as a result of
              Fay&#039;s mispronouncing &quot;brother&quot; as
              &quot;buzzer&quot;, which was then shortened to &quot;Buzz&quot;.
              He was a Boy Scout, achieving the rank of Tenderfoot Scout
